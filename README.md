## Development
When developing, please create a seperate branch with a descriptive name of the work you're trying to accomplish.
When issuing a Pull Request, please compare to the `dev` branch. The `dev` branch will function as the central place of all other branches, merging all changes into one working solution. When such a working solution is created, the dev branch may be compared and merged with the `master` branch.
